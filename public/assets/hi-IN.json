While readers initially drew connections between Kaiju No. 8 and series like Attack on Titan, Chainsaw Man, and One-Punch Man, fans soon fell in love with its unique elements, art style, and protagonist. The manga quickly became a global sensation. In the first six months, over 550,000 copies were in circulation. By March 2023, over 11 million copies were in circulation. When the Production I.G animation studio announced they were developing an anime series under the supervision of Studio khara, fans anxiously awaited to see the series adapted for the screen. \r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Kafka Hibino, a 32-year-old longing to join The Defense Force and make good on his promise to a childhood friend, Mina Ashiro. He befriends a new coworker Reno Ichikawa, while cleaning up Kaiju remains, whose determination to join The Defense Force inspires Kafka to fulfill his childhood promise to pass the entrance exam and join Mina to protect humanity. When a small Kaiju burrows itself inside Kafka, he gains superhuman strength and powers fit for fighting Kaiju. He works to earn the trust of his human teammates, defeat increasingly powerful Kaiju, and keep the world safe.","seasonCount":3,"year":2025,"lastReleaseDate":"2025-08-30T02:09:27Z","image":"https://www.crunchyroll.com/imgsrv/display/thumbnail/320x180/catalog/crunchyroll/c2257c075677c3bfe0d66b46411529fb.jpg","watchLink":"https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GG5H5XQ7D","languages":["ru-RU","fr-FR","de-DE","en-US","te-IN","es-419","pt-BR","hi-IN","es-ES","it-IT","ja-JP","ta-IN"],"keywords":["deutsche synchro","shonen","action","sci-fi","tomomi kamiya"],"episodeCount":20,"seasonTags":["summer-2025"]},{"id":"GZJH3D817","title":"The Roots of To Your Eternity","slug":"the-roots-of-to-your-eternity","description":"Deep dive into the fascinating creative journey of To Your Eternity through the exclusive statements of creators including Oima Yoshitoki, Kiyoko Sayama, etc., narrated by Kenjiro Tsuda.

Humanity survives behind massive walls against man-eating Titans. After a Colossal Titan destroys his home and kills his mother, Eren Jaeger joins the Scout Regiment with his friends, Mikasa and Armin, only to discover he can transform into a Titan himself. As Eren fights for humanity’s survival, he uncovers dark conspiracies, political intrigue, and the terrifying origins of the Titans.\r\n\r\nThe series features a complex ensemble of characters, each playing a pivotal role in humanity’s struggle for survival. The arcs of Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackermann, Armin Arlelt, and more explore themes of trauma, ideology, and the cyclical nature of violence, making Attack on Titan as much a psychological drama as an action epic.\r\n\r\nAttack on Titan spans four seasons and premiered in April 2013, with the first three seasons all animated by Wit Studio. Attack on Titan Final Season, produced by MAPPA, was split into multiple parts from December 2020 to November 2023. The last two specials, Attack on Titan Final Season THE FINAL CHAPTERS, were later edited together into one epic finale film titled Attack on Titan: THE LAST ATTACK.","seasonCount":6,"year":2025,"lastReleaseDate":"2025-04-18T00:05:53Z","image":"https://www.crunchyroll.com/imgsrv/display/thumbnail/320x180/catalog/crunchyroll/1dea4b0c71a1b3837e27077b93bfc217.jpg","watchLink":"https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR751KNZY","languages":["es-ES","pt-BR","fr-FR","ja-JP","es-419","de-DE","en-US"],"keywords":["adventure","fantasy","shounen","attack on titan","action","drama","thriller","post-apocalyptic","masashi koizuka","manga","hajime isayama","horror","tragedy","shingeki no kyojin","هجوم العمالفة","هجوم العمالقة","العمالقة"],"episodeCount":100,"seasonTags":["spring-2013","summer-2013","spring-2017","summer-2018","spring-2019","fall-2021","fall-2020","winter-2021","winter-2022","winter-2023","fall-2023"]},{"id":"GMEHME7W1","title":"Yakuza Fiancé: Raise wa Tanin ga Ii","slug":"yakuza-fianc-raise-wa-tanin-ga-ii","description":"Yoshino’s engagement is far from a dream come true.
