A pesar de ello, sueña con convertirse en el mayor héroe del mundo, como su ídolo, All Might.\r\nTras heredar por sorpresa el don de All Might, Izuku entra en la Academia de Héroes, donde entrenará con nuevas amistades, como su amigo de la infancia convertido en rival Katsuki Bakugo, el inteligente y fuerte Shoto Todoroki, Ochaco Uraraka o Tenya Iida. Juntos se harán más fuertes mientras descubren la dura realidad de lo que significa ser héroes.\r\n\r\nAunque las primeras temporadas de My Hero Academia se centran en la amistad, la madurez y la emoción de perseguir tus sueños, la segunda mitad de la serie aumenta la intensidad de las batallas y explora temas más oscuros, como el sacrificio, la pérdida o la complejidad del heroísmo.\r\n\r\nHasta ahora se han estrenado siete temporadas de My Hero Academia, una nueva casi cada año. Las tres primeras se emitieron a partir de abril de 2016 a 2018; mientras que las temporadas de la 4 a la 8 se lanzaron entre finales de 2019 y finales de 2025.

Cuando un titán colosal destruye su hogar y mata a su madre, Eren Jaeger se une a la Legión de Reconocimiento junto a sus amigos Mikasa y Armin, solo para descubrir que él mismo puede transformarse en titán. En su lucha por la supervivencia de la humanidad, Eren descubre conspiraciones, intrigas políticas y los aterradores orígenes de los titanes.\r\n\r\nLa serie presenta un complejo elenco de personajes, cada uno con un papel clave en la lucha de la humanidad por sobrevivir. Las historias de Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackermann, Armin Arlelt y otros abordan temas como el trauma, la ideología y la naturaleza cíclica de la violencia, lo que convierte a Ataque a los Titanes en un drama psicológico y una epopeya de acción.\r\n\r\nAtaque a los Titanes tuvo cuatro temporadas y se estrenó en abril de 2013, con sus tres primeras a cargo de Wit Studio.
